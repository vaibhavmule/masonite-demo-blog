#Masonite Demo Blog

This project allows one to create a blog via Masonite. 

This allows one to Create, Update, and Delete posts via Masonite Dashboard.

The each post can have a featured image. The user can write their posts in markdown syntax.

All one needs to do is add their db credentials into an .env file, run migrations, and register a new user.

Please give feedback. All contributions are welcome. Let's make Masonite great.
